Journal for second playtest on March 6th
Pinball game project

What has been added for this playtest
- Both red token and yellow token's special feature has been implemented and work perfectly in harmony.
  - Obviously, you can now collect the tokens (collision detected)
  - Red token makes an extra ball appear, yellow token gives you an extra life.
  - When you get extra balls, you will not lose a life until the last ball is gone.
  - When your life count is at 0, your whole score resets.

Positive aspects about playtest experience
- ?

Aspects to improve or suggestions
- Everytime you lose a ball, wether last one or not, the multiplier resets to 1, or else it is too easy to get a very high score.
- There could be a token that does something bad, so that you actually do not want too many balls or it will disadvantage you.

What I still have to work on (from last playtest)

----MANDATORY
- Work on the disposition of bumpers in regards to tokens (some spawnpoints easier to collect than other)
- Work on the tokens' spawning timer (has to be in relation to collision with ball and token. When one is collected, the spawntimer
should reset to zero so that one doesn't reappear right away.)
- Implement at least one bad special token :
  - Blue token: disables your flippers. (initially the idea was to make them disappear)
- Think of tokens' esthetics: how to make players understand that some are bad and some are good?

----DETAILS
- Modify the board to make it more esthetic (new bumpers, new flippers, etc.)
- Improve ball behaviour (lighter/faster? Bouncier?)
- Possibly a fourth token?

There wasn't much to say for this playtest...? Have to keep working on it.
