Journal for first playtest on Feb 20st

Positive aspects about playtest experience
- The coins look "yummmy" (spinning behaviour well done!)
- Player is attracted to them, wants to collect them
- They are appearing at different spots, it offers a great level of challenge/makes it interesting

Aspects to improve
- Nothing happens when player collects coins (no feedback), disappointment
- Perhaps there should be some way of letting the player know when the coin is about to disappear
- Coins are hard to catch sometimes, perhaps I need to rethink their spawnpoints
- There should be more coins on the screen

Overall:
It is no surprise to me that the player was deceived when he realised nothing happens when he collects a coin. Fortunately, that is not
a game mechanics choice, it's simply due to lack of time, and that feature will be implemented for sure for the next playtest. I need to
think of strategic spawnpoints rather than being totally random (some should be harder to collect, some should be easier, etc...) There
should be strong correlation between the bumper's position and the spawnpoints', as the bumpers direct the ball. Also, I need to work on
the esthetics of my pinball game. The ball's behaviour seems slightly off, sometimes when it gets stuck in a corner it takes very
long to come back into the game.

What to implement for future playtest
- Work on the relation between bumpers and tokens
- Work on the tokens' spawning timer (has to be in relation to collision with ball and token. When one is collected, the spawntimer
should reset to zero so that one doesn't reappear right away.)
- Implement special tokens feature :
  - Red token gives you an extra ball
  - Yellow token gives you an extra life
  - Blue token (not yet there) makes your flippers disappear for a short period
  - Possibly a fourth one: Green token disables the bumpers
- Modify the board to make it more esthetic (new bumpers, new flippers, etc.)
- Think of tokens' esthetics: how to make players understand that some are bad and some are good?
- Improve ball behaviour (lighter/faster? Bouncier?)
