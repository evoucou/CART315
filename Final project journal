Last journal concerning the final version, due on Wednesday April 10th

What has been added or improved for the final version
- Lots of cool sounds were added, as well as a pinball-themed music.
- Color coding, as suggested by a student, with the extra life token and the extra life text so we understand better (both the same blue.
- Player gets more feedback from the game;
  - When flippers are deactivated, they are transparent and there is a ticking sound.
  - When player collects a coin, a message appears on the screen such as "extra life!" or "extra ball!"
- The ball's fluidity has been improved so now you can easily get it everywhere on the board to collect coins.
- There was one problem that was brought to my attention by Joachim; having more than one balls was not necessarily a good thing,
so I had to find a way to make it a good thing. I decided to add a new feature. While it is very risky to add anything at this stage of
the game, I am confident that it was necessary in order to fix that problem. So, the implemented feature is that, when you
have three balls or more on the board, two smaller other bumpers appear;
   - The player can see them at the beginning of the game because they are transparent, but he does not necessarily know how to trigger them
   - I want him to explore my game, which is why I haven't clearly explained everything from the beginning. However, the player has
enough feedback from the game so that he does not get bored or discouraged.
- Overall, the whole esthetic appearance was improved. It now looks like a real pinball machine!
- I have also added a very basic menu screen at the beginning whiche explains the commands mostly.
- Another rather important change that I made; I played with the code responsible for spawning the tokens so that they never spawn at the
same spot.

Overall, I have worked as hard as I could to deliver a game that gives the player enough feedback while not giving away all the answers.
I hope that the esthetics and sounds make it a bit more fun to play, and that the very little UI part makes it more interactive and real.
There is no way to lose, therefore you can play as much as you want! I am confident that the code works well, however, I think it is normal
to expect that will still be some minor bugs.
