Journal for third playtest on March 27th
Pinball game project

Suggestions from last playtest
- Everytime you lose a ball, wether last one or not, the multiplier resets to 1, or else it is too easy to get a very high score.
- There could be a token that does something bad, so that you actually do not want too many balls or it will disadvantage you.

What has been added for this playtest
- When you lose one ball, the multiplier resets to zero.
- A blue token has been added, however, the special features have been switched around;
  - The red token disables the flippers (new feature that has been added for this playtests).
  - Before, the red token made an extra ball appear. Now, the blue token is responsible for that.
  - I used the red token because red most of the time equals to bad, or danger. (disabled flippers is bad)
  - The yellow token still gives the player an extra life. That hasn't changed.
- The esthetics of the board have been slightly improved and the structure changed a little bit.
  - The bumpers have been moved so that their emplacement is more strategic (makes tokens collection possible or easier, or in a bad way
  so it sends the ball to the side corridors, for instance)
- I added two corridors on each side of the board which the player should avoid, because when the ball falls into them, it goes under
your flippers and therefore you lose the ball.
  - However, these corridors can be blocked with red "doors" that go up and down with a red round pressure plate, which is triggered
  by the ball.
  
Positive aspects about playtest experience
- Cool implementations of the three different tokens.

Aspects to improve or suggestions for final
- There could be a sound when player collects a token (maybe a different one for each color)
- Hard to tell which token does what. This could be resolved with color coding, such as the extra life text is yellow just like the token.
- Player needs more feedback; example, when the flippers are deactivated, they should change aspect visually while they are off.
- Right now, multiple balls feel like it is not necessarily a good thing but rather a bad thing, because the more you have, the harder it
is to keep your multiplier and get a high score. Maybe find a way to make multiple balls an asset?
- It is a little hard to get the ball to the top of the board.
- The extra life text is overlapping with the score text.

Bugs that were encountered
- The ball got stuck in the narrow space between the door blocking the corridor and the wall underneath.
- When the ball resets, it sometimes bounces over the spring and lands under it at the bottom of the board (we cannot access it anymore)

What I still have to work on (what hasn't been implemented since last playtest and still isn't)

----MANDATORY
- Work on the tokens' spawning timer (has to be in relation to collision with ball and token. When one is collected, the spawntimer
should reset to zero so that one doesn't reappear right away.)

----DETAILS
- Modify the board to make it more esthetic (new bumpers, new flippers, textures, etc.)
- Improve ball behaviour (lighter/faster? Bouncier?)
- Possibly a fourth token?

Overall
The playtest went well, however I really should focus on feedback as there currently isn't a lot. Players should be able to understand what
the tokens do right away, and should identifiy which ones are bad and which ones are good.
